"""Your server. Two tools to write; mcp_servers/pdf_server.py is the reference.

A tool is an ordinary function with @mcp.tool() above it. The type hints become
the JSON schema a model reads, and this docstring becomes the tool description,
so run `python call_tool.py --list` after each change and look at what you made.

Read files only through mcp_servers._pdf, and write only through
safe_output_path, which confines writes to output/ the same way the PDF tools
are confined to papers/.
